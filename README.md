# IRC Cloud Keep Alive Utility
A simple heroku application to keep your irccloud connection alive always (without paying :dollar:)!

Let me start this by saying *None of this is illegal*  
IRC Cloud has publicly documented their api and different RPC calls they make.  
Its publicly listed on github and you can read it here [IRC Cloud Wiki](https://github.com/irccloud/irccloud-tools/wiki).

**IMPORTANT :** In order to get going, please read this blog article which details the usage of this application.

## Requirements
### Heroku
* A Free heroku account
* Python 3.7
  * Requests library
  
### For use in your own VPS
- Be sure to have `python-dev` installed in your machine.  
- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/vijaiaeroastro/irccloud.git`  
- Enter into the cloned repository with `cd irccloud`  
- Install the requirements with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- If the above command fails, install `python-pip`  
- Use the bash script `irccloud_cronjob` provided for ease of use  
- You can also specify everything on a `crontab` entry instead. Just type `crontab -e`, choose your favourite text editor  
and add this to it (this will  be executed every hour):  
`0 * * * * IRCCLOUD_USERNAME="your@email.address" IRCCLOUD_PASSWORD="your_password" python3 /home/irccloud/irccloud/irccloud.py >/dev/null 2>&1`
**NOTE**: If you have a VPS running Linux, i assume you know how to use basic Linux commands. I would highly advise you to do what suits your workflow the most.
